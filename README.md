# Evoting
Abstract:

This idea proposes an online voting system with Aadhar for Indian elections. The proposed paradigm offers more security because voting turnout is higher.
Before a vote is counted, the security password is verified in the Election Commission of India's main database. The model's added feature allows the voter to verify that the right candidate or party received their vote. In this arrangement, a voter has the option to cast a ballot from a place other than the one designated for them or from their favourite site. The counting of the votes will be done automatically under the proposed approach, saving a significant amount of time and allowing the Election Commissioner of India to declare the results quickly.
